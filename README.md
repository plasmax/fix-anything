## 📖 Overview

FixAnything is a single generalist video model that repairs rendering artifacts from **any** 3D representation — 3DGS, NeRF, meshes, or sparse point clouds — by repurposing a pretrained video diffusion model with minimal modification and finetuning. 

This repository contains the inference code.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kvuong2711/fix-anything.git
cd fix-anything

conda create -n fixanything python=3.10 -y
conda activate fixanything

# PyTorch for your CUDA version
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

# FixAnything + the pinned DiffSynth-Studio commit it builds on
# (DiffSynth's setup.py needs pkg_resources, hence setuptools<82 and --no-build-isolation)
pip install "setuptools<82" wheel
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .

# Optional: MapAnything + pyrender, to reconstruct and render your own captures (see below)
pip install --no-build-isolation -e ".[mapanything]"

# Optional but recommended: FlashAttention-2 (used automatically when installed; prebuilt wheel for torch 2.6 / CUDA 12 / Python 3.10)
pip install https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiTRUE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

## 📦 Checkpoints

`scripts/download_models.py` downloads everything into `checkpoints/`: the Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P base model (~60 GB, from Hugging Face or `--source modelscope`) and the FixAnything LoRA from [kvuong2711/fix-anything](https://huggingface.co/kvuong2711/fix-anything):

```bash
python scripts/download_models.py --model_dir checkpoints
```

The expected layout is:

```
checkpoints/
├── Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P/
│   ├── diffusion_pytorch_model-0000?-of-00007.safetensors
│   ├── models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth
│   ├── Wan2.1_VAE.pth
│   ├── models_clip_open-clip-xlm-roberta-large-vit-huge-14.pth
│   └── google/umt5-xxl/
└── fixanything_lora.safetensors
```

If you already have the Wan2.1 files elsewhere, point `--model_dir` to the folder that contains `Wan-AI/`.

### Optional: pre-encode the prompts and drop the text encoder

FixAnything uses fixed prompts, so the 11 GB umT5-XXL text encoder always produces the same embeddings. `scripts/encode_prompts.py` computes them once (a ~13 MB `prompt_embeds.pt`); afterwards `run_inference.py` picks that file up automatically, skips loading the text encoder and tokenizer, and `models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth` can be deleted:

```bash
python scripts/encode_prompts.py --model_dir checkpoints
rm checkpoints/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P/models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth   # optional
```

To use a custom prompt later, encode it first (`--prompt "..."` / `--negative_prompt "..."`; the file is merged, not overwritten), or pass `--prompt_embeds none` to `run_inference.py` to load the text encoder instead.

## 🚀 Run Inference on a Rendered Video

`run_inference.py` refines a rendered video (a video file, or a folder of frames). `examples/` contains one DL3DV clip rendered by 3D Gaussian Splatting and by a sparse point-track renderer:

```bash
# 3DGS rendering
python scripts/run_inference.py --input examples/dl3dv_3dgs/input.mp4   --output_dir outputs/dl3dv_3dgs

# sparse point-track rendering
python scripts/run_inference.py --input examples/dl3dv_tracks/input.mp4 --output_dir outputs/dl3dv_tracks
```

Each run writes `generated.mp4` (refined video), `input.mp4` (the resized input) and `side_by_side.mp4` (input | refined) to the output folder.

To run on your own rendering (any 3D representation), pass a video of 61 frames rendered along a camera path, ideally starting and ending at views used to build the representation. Frames are resized to 832×480.

- **Caveat on the number of frames.** Internally the last frame is repeated 4 times (65 frames): the Wan VAE encodes the first frame on its own but compresses the rest temporally, so this (hopefully) gives the last frame more influence to the generation. The output is cropped back to 61 frames.
- **`--clean_frame_indices`** lists the frames to keep as-is; by default the first and last frames (`"0 60"`).

## 📷 Run on Your Own Captures

If you only have a few photos of a scene, `scripts/run_mapanything.py` reconstructs them with [MapAnything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/map-anything), renders the reconstruction along a camera path from the first to the last image, and FixAnything turns that rendering into a clean video. `examples/microkitchen_2views` and `examples/chair_2views` each contain two photos of a scene (credit: thanks to Peter Hedman for the photos!):

```bash
# 1) MapAnything reconstruction + rendering (61 frames; first/last frame = the input photos)
python scripts/run_mapanything.py --images examples/microkitchen_2views/images --output_dir outputs/microkitchen_2views

# 2) FixAnything
python scripts/run_inference.py --input outputs/microkitchen_2views/rendered.mp4 --output_dir outputs/microkitchen_2views
```

Step 1 writes `rendered.mp4` and `reconstruction.glb`; step 2 adds `generated.mp4` (the result) and `side_by_side.mp4`.

- `--trajectory`: `interpolate` (default) moves the camera on a straight path between the two input views; `push_in` additionally dollies toward the scene mid-path and back.
- `--render`: render the reconstruction as a triangle `mesh` (default) or as a point cloud (`pcd`).

Example on `examples/microkitchen_2views` with `--trajectory push_in`:
